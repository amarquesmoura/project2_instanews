# Instanews Project

This is a project to showcase code in jQuery and Ajax to make use of an API and the resulting JSON response as part of the Web Development Program at RED Academy. It also involved writing in Sass and using Gulp task automator.

## Skills learned

- Installing Gulp and dependencies
- Creating a gulpfile to automate tasks
- Using Ajax to make API queries
- Manipulating data in JSON
- Writing in Sass syntax
- Using variables and operators in Sass
- Creating and using mixing in Sass
- Compiling CSS from Sass
- CSS3 transitions and animations

## Description

A single page website including a logo, drop-down selector, dinamic section for articles display and footer. This project has 3 different layouts according to screen sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile. It required manipulating the HTML DOM through Javascript with jQuery.

## Main Takeaways

1 - Dinamic websites are made possible by the use of scripts, with functions like 'show' and 'hide', 'append', and 'empty'.

2 - A preprocessor like Sass can be used to better organize the styling code. Using partials allow us to separate in different documents what otherwise would be a long and difficult to navigate code. Additionally, nesting, variables, operators, functions and especially mixins optimize writing the code, eliminating unecessary repetitions.

3 - Gulp, like other task automators, is very handy, since it can be used to synch the browser with the code being developed, reducing the cumbersome process of saving-and-refreshing. It also can be used to other tasks like minifying CSS and linting JavaScript.

4 - APIs are a very powerful way to add value to a website. Most of the value of the Internet is in the access to the desired information. By means of APIs, we can include data from a number of different sources into our website.

5 - Navigating through the JSON object that APIs usually return, we can select what pieces of information we will use and manipulate them in JavaScript and jQuery.
