HTML:
Good symantics for each section and div in your hmtl. Its understandable and makes sence. Great idea for putting the loader gif
in your html and then using ajax to call it. I would suggest that a div around the info added from the api would give a better
visual of where the info is appended.

JS:
Maybe remove some of the unessasry comments for your JS, some of them are good. The ones that describe the functions only.
You used you const and let variables properly in your js.

.git 
You have all the requirements 

CSS:
Have some image positioning errors and aligning of text and other items.
